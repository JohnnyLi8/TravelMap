# TravelMap - 2019
Travel Map Generator

Download the repository, fill in your Google Maps API keys, and run the Excel.py file.

Improvements to be made:
- make the program select the right zoom-in level of the map (need to do some experiments)
- add text next to the scattered points (can't achieve it using gmplot)
